So when WWF approached me to take up this water challenge for Earth Hour, I figured that it’s time to walk my talk about water!</p>\n<p>So here it is: Five easy ways to reduce water wastage and my verdict on the measures!</p>\n<p><strong>1. Run your taps at half speed</strong></p>\n<p>Turning on the tap up to the halfway mark immediately halves the water flow and the amount used. This can be applied to any activity, from brushing your teeth to washing vegetables. As less water was used, I could turn down the heater and actually ended up using less energy for heating!</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Ease of adoption: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';\">4/5</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Verdict:</strong> I definitely enjoy having strong jets of running water and habitually turn the full tap on. But I have made a conscious effort to turn it down and am starting to appreciate a steady flow. </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>2. Rinse from a mug</strong></p>\n<p>Forget about running water at half tap. You can further limit your water usage by using a mug when rinsing your mouth!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-01-Small.png\" alt=\"chart-01-Small\" width=\"1603\" height=\"883\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-01-Small.png 1603w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-01-Small-300x165.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-01-Small-1024x564.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1603px) 100vw, 1603px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Ease of adoption:</strong> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';\">3/5</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Verdict: </strong>It still takes a bit of getting used to. I tried washing the foam off my mouth with a mug but inevitably need to supplement the act with some tap water. I’m hoping it gets better throughout the week…</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>3. Turn off when soaping up</strong></p>\n<p>Turn on the shower only when necessary, and you can enjoy your shower for as long as you like! Take your time to massage your head while shampooing. Give your body a good scrub down. All while doing your part for the planet.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2157\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-02-Small.png\" alt=\"chart-02-Small\" width=\"1336\" height=\"736\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-02-Small.png 1336w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-02-Small-300x165.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/chart-02-Small-1024x564.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1336px) 100vw, 1336px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Ease of adoption:</strong> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';\">5/5</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Thankfully, I’ve never had the habit of keeping my shower running while soaping up. But even that bit of consciousness in the bathroom made a huge difference. If I had kept my shower running the whole time, I would have used twice the usual amount of water!</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>4. Flush at half, check for ticks!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We use about 3.5 to 4.5 litres of water per flush, four times the amount released from our deed! This is why PUB has introduced “water ticks”. Not that our water will make you itch, but there are </span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';\">✓</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> marks to denote the water efficiency of our appliances. </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Going to the toilet five times a day would mean 20 litres of water used. We can easily save 10 litres a day just by half-flushing!</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Ease of adoption:</strong> </span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';\">5/5</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Verdict:</strong> My half-flush button at home doesn’t work and I simply moderated how hard I pressed the flush button &#8211; it worked just fine!</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>5. Reuse creatively</strong></p>\n<p>Water from washing rice, fruits and vegetables is generally clean and can be reused for other purposes such as watering plants. Each wash uses about 2.5 litres of water, which adequately waters my plants at home. Rice water also happens to be really nutritious so your plants will grow to be strong and healthy, too!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2160\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cat-watering-plant-photo.jpg\" alt=\"cat watering plant photo\" width=\"960\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cat-watering-plant-photo.jpg 960w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cat-watering-plant-photo-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ease of adoption:</strong> 5/5</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I came up with other possibilities to reuse water. Bath water could be a good rinse for cars, too, since shampoo is said to give them a good shine! So, challenge your creative mind today!</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">FINAL THOUGHTS:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">When I applied these five simple tweaks to my daily routine, from bathing to brushing teeth to watering my plants, I was able to save 60 litres of water in just one day, 40% the amount of water used by an average person in Singapore everyday! This means if every person in Singapore follows these steps, we save enough to enjoy ten days of free water each month! </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I had thought that the biggest challenge would be getting used to a weaker water flow. Surprisingly, I was still (if not better) able to get clean from a less powerful jet. Then, I realised that the challenge is not in adopting these measures, but in getting rid of my bad habits. </span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">As a Singaporean and greenie at heart, nothing satisfies me more than knowing that I am not just making a difference to the environment, my wallet will thank me too</span></p>\n<hr class=\"stag-divider stag-divider--plain\" />\n<p>Written by Tay Wee Leng</p>\n<p><em>Wee Leng writes about environmental issues and social causes on </em><a href=\"http://earthleng.com\"><em>earthleng.com</em></a><em>.

It started from a local community’s farming land and the bushes area nearby Pakning Asal village. After three days of intense fire-fighting, the fire was successfully put off without causing more damage than approximately one hectare of forest bushes that were burnt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG-20180213-WA0090-1.jpg?fit=975%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3481\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG-20180213-WA0090-1.jpg 1280w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG-20180213-WA0090-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG-20180213-WA0090-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><figcaption>Around 20 people including MPA members, police, army and government officials were involved to put out the fire.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WWF has built 22 canal blocks to-date to rehydrate peatlands and prevent them from burning in dry seasons, ultimately ensuring that the haze stops. The result: no peat fire has been reported (Singapore has gone haze-free for three years since the crisis in 2015!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.wwf.sg/our_work/living_planet_report_2018_/\"><strong>It&#8217;s official: we&#8217;ve lost 60% of biodiversity</strong></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of WWF&#8217;s Living Planet Report 2018 revealed that <strong>in just 44 years</strong>, we’ve lost 60% of biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, we hear countless news reports on poaching, habitat loss and deforestation everyday.

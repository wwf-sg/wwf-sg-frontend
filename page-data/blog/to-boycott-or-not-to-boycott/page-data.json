The expansion of the palm oil industry has given even more people opportunities, such as education, that they would not have otherwise had. Boycott palm oil and you unintentionally take away a regular income and opportunities for millions of people.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BRGj0DwYwA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Palm oil is the most efficient oil in the world</strong></h3>\n<p>Palm oil produces up to <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.au/our_work/saving_the_natural_world/forests/palm_oil/what_wwf_is_doing/certified_sustainable_palm_oil/\" target=\"_blank\">NINE</a> times more oil per hectare than its closest alternatives like rapeseed, sunflower, soy or peanut oil. So it takes less land to grow more palm oil.  Plus, it is a very versatile product and it can be adapted for many uses. In shampoos it adds gloss, in lipstick it fixes colour. As a result palm oil is in around 50% of the goods on <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/which-everyday-products-contain-palm-oil\" target=\"_blank\">on supermarket shelves</a> from food products like noodles and pizza to soaps, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Like it or not, it is almost inextricably woven into our lives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/comparisons-of-alternative-oils.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-242 aligncenter\" src=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/comparisons-of-alternative-oils-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"comparisons of alternative oils\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /><br />\n</a></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Boycotting palm oil could lead to MORE deforestation</strong></h3>\n<p>The demand for vegetable oil is not going to go away. In fact individual consumption of vegetable oil has grown more than any other food in the last <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/\" target=\"_blank\">30 years</a>. Production of palm oil, in particular, has doubled over the last decade and is expected to double again by 2050. If we stop using palm oil it is likely to be replaced with another, less efficient, crop and more land will be needed to meet that growing demand for vegetable oil. The result could be further <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/deforestation/\" target=\"_blank\">deforestation</a> and faster <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.au/our_work/wwf_global_work/wwf_global_flagship_species/borneo_orang_utans/\" target=\"_blank\">loss of species</a>. Not something that anyone wants to see happen.</p>\n<p>WWF has weighed it all up and we believe supporting sustainable, <a href=\"http://www.rspo.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">RSPO</a>, palm oil is the best bet to limit deforestation, species loss, haze pollution and climate change. By encouraging the uptake of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) we can tackle the serious social and environmental problems associated with unsustainable palm oil production.</p>\n<h3><b>3 things to do instead of boycotting</b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Start now by insisting on a switch to sustainable palm oil in your everyday products. Pledge your support at <a href=\"http://webreathewhatwebuy.com\" target=\"_blank\">XtheHaze.org</a>.</li>\n<li>Check out the <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/solutions/responsible_purchasing/palm_oil_buyers_scorecard_2013/\" target=\"_blank\">WWF Palm Oil Scorecard</a> to see which companies are heading towards 100% sustainable palm oil and support their products. Our CSPO options are still way too limited, so we need to keep up the push for more choices. Also look out for updated WWF Scorecards, including a Singapore Scorecard, coming in 2016, and see just how much progress companies are really making.</li>\n<li>Support WWF&#8217;s <a href=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/emergency/\" target=\"_blank\">emergency appeal</a> to get medical supplies, safety masks and clothing, pumps and fire extinguishers to those still fighting fires. And support WWF as we rehabilitate and replant forests in Kalimantan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","uri":"to-boycott-or-not-to-boycott/","author":{"name":"Louise Wood","slug":"louise-wood","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08b72de95886dc800efe0347f324f87a?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"featuredImage":{"altText":"","srcSet":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boycottxthehaze.png 1500w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boycottxthehaze-300x160.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boycottxthehaze-768x410.png 768w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boycottxthehaze-1024x546.png 1024w"},"tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"#XtheHaze","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/xthehaze/","slug":"xthehaze"},{"name":"Haze","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/haze/","slug":"haze"},{"name":"Palm Oil","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/palm-oil/","slug":"palm-oil"},{"name":"RSPO","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/rspo/","slug":"rspo"}]},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Forest","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/forest/","slug":"forest"},{"name":"Haze","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/haze/","slug":"haze"}]},"campaigns":{"nodes":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyNTE=","uri":"to-boycott-or-not-to-boycott/","title":"To boycott or not to boycott","databaseId":251,"slug":"to-boycott-or-not-to-boycott","excerpt":"<p>3 reasons NOT to boycott palm oil products. 1.

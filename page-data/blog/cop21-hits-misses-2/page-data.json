They’ve also stated 2018 as a critical global moment for countries to come back to the table, and take stronger actions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Light_the_way-735x450.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-334 aligncenter\" src=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Light_the_way-735x450.jpg\" alt=\"Light_the_way-735x450\" width=\"735\" height=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<h2>4. “Loss &amp; Damage”</h2>\n<p>[stag_columns][stag_one_half]<strong>What we like</strong><br />\nIt has been recognised that many countries &#8211; particularly low-lying island states &#8211; are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change and will need protection.<br />\n[/stag_one_half] [stag_one_half_last]<strong>What we don&#8217;t like</strong><br />\nBut not much is said about securing the support they need!

A clear goal to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050</h2>\n<p><strong>What we like</strong><br />\nAll governments and finance institutions (e.g. World Bank) have agreed that far more lending needs to go into solar, wind and other green energy technologies, and far less should go into fossil fuels. Many commentators have said that the Paris agreement signals the end of the fossil fuel era, ushering in a new movement for renewable energy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1012167.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-337 size-large\" title=\"Test2\" src=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1012167-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Test\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" /></a></p>\n<h2>6. A goal to protect forests &#8211; by halting deforestation and degradation, and improving land management.</h2>\n<p><strong>What we like</strong><br />\nThe agreement also includes a process that can provide guidance for land sector accounting. On the sidelines of COP21, the UK and Norway also pledged an additional $5 billion by 2020 to help developing countries protect their forests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fcp_cop21_infographic8_01_1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-326 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://webreathewhatwebuy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fcp_cop21_infographic8_01_1-1024x724.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"481\" /></a><br />\n<strong>But all in all, the Paris agreement is only the beginning of a long road ahead.<br />\nMuch of the agreement is not legally binding &#8211; future governments could renegade on their commitments, and as with all UN<br />\nagreements, countries cannot be forced to do more than they commit to. </strong><br />\nWhen delegates return from Paris, the real work begins. Governments, corporates and civil society need to work hand in hand to achieve the critical 1.5 degree limit we require to preserve humanity.</p>\n","uri":"cop21-hits-misses-2/","author":{"name":"Louise Wood","slug":"louise-wood","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08b72de95886dc800efe0347f324f87a?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"featuredImage":{"altText":"","srcSet":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/adapting-to-climate-change.jpg 1600w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/adapting-to-climate-change-300x113.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/adapting-to-climate-change-768x288.jpg 768w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/adapting-to-climate-change-1024x384.jpg 1024w"},"tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"Climate Change","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/climate-change/","slug":"climate-change"},{"name":"COP21","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/cop21/","slug":"cop21"},{"name":"Forest","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/forest/","slug":"forest"},{"name":"Paris","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/paris/","slug":"paris"},{"name":"UNFCCC","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/unfccc/","slug":"unfccc"}]},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Climate Change","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/climate-change/","slug":"climate-change"},{"name":"Haze","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/haze/","slug":"haze"}]},"campaigns":{"nodes":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDozNTQ=","uri":"cop21-hits-misses-2/","title":"COP21: Hits &#038; Misses","databaseId":354,"slug":"cop21-hits-misses-2","excerpt":"<p>1.

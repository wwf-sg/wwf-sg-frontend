It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004 and was later included in the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2011.</p>\n<p>While Sumatra may seem less of a concern for Singaporeans since it is not situated within our national boundary, here are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">three reasons</span> why it is important and relevant for us to preserve the site:</p>\n<h6>1. IT AFFECTS THEM</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from its importance in conserving the archipelago’s biodiversity, the rainforest is also crucial to the well-being of those who depend on it for food and income. In fact, out of the 11 million whose lives are supported by the natural heritage sites, 6 million are living in or near the rainforest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to increasing demand in palm oil and timber however, poorly-regulated logging and land-clearing practices are causing large-scale deforestation in Sumatra, threatening local residents&#8217; trading way of life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1621 size-full\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sumatra-women.jpg\" alt=\"Talang Mamak people.

The local residents’ trading way of life is threatened by forest clearance for oil palm plantations.</span></i></span></p>\n<h6>2. IT AFFECTS US</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The damage doesn’t just stay within the boundary. Its impact can cross geographical borders and cause regional environmental disasters. The 2015 Southeast Asian Haze, which affected several countries in Southeast Asia including Singapore, was a painful episode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haze pollution not only threatened our health, but also brought about economic loss to our country. It caused an estimated economic loss of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/haze-episode-cost/2605406.html\">S$700 million</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Singapore and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was largely a result of the forest fires triggered by the “slash-and-burn” method practiced by unsustainable oil palm and pulp and paper plantations..</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1622 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Blog-haze.jpg\" alt=\"A general view of a housing estate covered by haze in Singapore. The haze was the result of illegal burning of forests and other land on Sumatra island in Indonesia to make way for palm oil plantations and is causing Singaporeans to experience physical discomfort migraines, burning eyes, rashes, dry throats and runny noses and in cases of weaker individuals, asthma attacks and respiratory issues. Some offices and businesses have even suspended operations, to ensure their employees and customers are not exposed to the hazardous haze. Singapore's air pollution soared to a record of 401 on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI).\" width=\"800\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Blog-haze.jpg 800w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Blog-haze-300x171.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2015 Southeast Asian Haze was detrimental to various affected countries including Singapore.</span></i></span></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. IT AFFECTS EVERYONE</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deforestation in Sumatra is a global concern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The clearing of forested area has severely damaged the habitat of critically-endangered animal species, pushing them towards the brink of extinction. As of today, there remains only 7300 <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-orangutan\">Sumatran orangutans</a> and as few as 400 <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-tiger\">Sumatran tigers</a>, all are holding on for survival in forests that are slowly disappearing. The loss of biodiversity affects the <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity_and_you/\">interdependent ecosystem</a> as a whole and it should be stopped in order to protect everyone on Earth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deforestation also contributes to climate change. When trees are cut down, the carbon that was previously absorbed and stored by the forests is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. On top of that, large amount of carbon dioxide is generated from the burning of trees, releasing even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are one of the leading culprits of climate change and up to a fifth of global emissions come from deforestation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1695 \" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blog-deforestation.jpg\" alt=\"Illegal logging for paper industry and forest clearing for Palm oil plantation.

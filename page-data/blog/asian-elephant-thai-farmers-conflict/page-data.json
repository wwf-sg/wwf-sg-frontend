This area had been, after all, their home for 10,000 years. Also, they were just hungry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearing of forests had removed food and water sources for the elephants, rendering it impossible for the herds to stay put. When they saw that their new neighbours were stocked with an abundance of crops, desperation for food and water kicked in.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It walked right through the village,&#8221; a villager described. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Stealing the crops is not a big problem, but stomping on them is.

The decision was made to purchase six GPS collars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of our research on studying the behaviour of wild elephants, we can now track elephant movement patterns when they come out of the Eastern Forest Complex to the village,&#8221; said Dr Supagit Vinitpornsawan, Head of Dong Phayayen &#8211; Khao Yai Wildlife Research Station. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5171\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>&#8220;Another reason to implement this project is to try and reduce the human-elephant conflict.

The research team had been practising for more than a month to collar an elephant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a misty morning, which proved to be risky for the team to approach the elephant with blurred vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57.png?fit=975%2C497&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5120\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57.png 1235w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57-300x153.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57-1024x522.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px\" /><figcaption>Morning of the collaring day.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the skies cleared within half an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team had received information that the leader of an elephant herd had been crossing the same road for over two weeks. The herd of elephants would leave the forest in the evening to look for food and return in the early morning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiting in position, the team finally spotted the elephant targeted for collaring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02.png?fit=975%2C496&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5121\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02.png 1243w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02-300x153.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02-1024x521.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1243px) 100vw, 1243px\" /><figcaption>The leader of the herd of elephants.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once tranquillised, the task of collaring the targeted elephant had to be carried out swiftly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sedatives would wear off after an hour.

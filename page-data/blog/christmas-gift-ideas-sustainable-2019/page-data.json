Pair with denim pants and stark white sneakers for a laid-back vibe &#8211; but go for coloured bottoms to elevate the look instantly. The tee features a crew neck, tapered shoulders and the widest range of sizes so that you can be all matchy with the children in the family. <em>Get yours at <a href=\"https://shop.wwf.sg/collections/apparel?utm_source=wwf&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=1912-gift-guide&amp;utm_content=tee-p\" class=\"ek-link\">shop.wwf.sg</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>Sustainable Seafood Lovers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RISE-Interior-1.jpg?fit=975%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5439\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RISE-Interior-1.jpg 5056w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RISE-Interior-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RISE-Interior-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5056px) 100vw, 5056px\" /><figcaption>The one-for-one lunch buffet is available for one day only (18 Dec) from<em> </em>12-2.30pm. <br><em>© Marina Bay Sands</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to someone’s heart is a feel-good feast set in an elegant setting.

For the wild elephants, the Eastern Forest Complex has been their home for the past four centuries. Conflict started when human development threatens their home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, both elephants and humans act against each other, leading to more severe attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>The &#8220;chosen&#8221; ones to get collared</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARN9808.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4281\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARN9808.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARN9808-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>The launch was executed by WWF-Thailand and the Department of National Parks (DNP), Wildlife and Plant Conservation.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand </em><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The elephants were not chosen at random. In fact, the DNP team was following the elephants&#8217; behaviour for sometime before they narrowed down to one elephant from the group. One characteristic they look out for: it needs to be a leader and have peers. This ensures that the selected one can represent the movements of a group after installation of collar. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the elephants can be too big or aggressive to be collared. When this happens, the field team will have select another suitable candidate or dedicate another day to collar them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small_WW269588.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4315\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small_WW269588.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small_WW269588-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>WWF-Myanmar&#8217;s Dr. Christy Williams (right) is tracking the movements of collared elephants to ensure they are safe.<br><em>© Julia Thiemann / WWF-Germany</em><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to WWF-Myanmar country director Christy Williams, the elephants will usually be curious and touch the collar often for the first few days, but will eventually feel like a watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When you wear your watch, you don&#8217;t feel it right?&#8221; he explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaring the elephants will also help the field team to define areas the elephants are using the most to patrol smarter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data collected from the collars will also help us and local communities to anticipate the elephants’ movements and plan intervention strategies (harmless to both elephants and humans) to effectively reduce conflict issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“These collars will be used to study the migratory movements of these elephants so as to resolve the issue of elephants coming in and destroying the agricultural lands. This is not an issue that comes down to whether elephants kill people or people kill elephants &#8212; it’s about finding a viable solution where elephants can live in harmony with people in the future</em>,” said Dr Pinsak Suraswadi, Deputy Director-General of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to join coalitions with the local authorities, communities and villagers and governments to ensure that humans and elephants can co-exist peacefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This (protecting the elephants) needs to be a movement, not just a project we are doing,&#8221; Dr. Christy Williams concluded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Quotes from WWF-Myanmar country director Christy Williams are adapted from the video &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNp58ScFY&amp;t=315s\">Meet Myanmar&#8217;s Elephant Whisperer</a>&#8220;.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read our stories in the field about the </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/endangered-species/2019/02/rare-sumatran-tiger-found-near-a-human-settlement-what-does-it-mean/\"><strong><em>rare Sumatran tiger found near a human settlement</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2018/11/beached-whale-plastic-pollution-wakatobi-indonesia/\"><strong><em>why there was a stranded whale in Wakatobi waters</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and someone&#8217;s job that could </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2019/01/marine-animals-palawan-philippines-wwf/\"><strong><em>protect more than a million hectares of marine lives in Palawan</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>\n","uri":"asian-elephant-wild-eastern-thailand/","author":{"name":"Sharon Salim","slug":"ssalim","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e36b8ae309f36dfc7c9fe446f89fd97d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"asian elephants","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/asian-elephants/"},{"name":"data collection","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/data-collection/"},{"name":"elephant collaring","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/elephant-collaring/"},{"name":"Endangered Species","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/endangered-species/"},{"name":"human elephant conflict","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/human-elephant-conflict/"}]},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Endangered Species","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/endangered-species/"},{"name":"Forest","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/forest/"}]}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDo0MjA4","uri":"asian-elephant-wild-eastern-thailand/","title":"Collaring Wild Elephants to Save Their Lives","databaseId":4208,"slug":"asian-elephant-wild-eastern-thailand","excerpt":"<p>Collaring a giant creature takes a lot of hard work.
